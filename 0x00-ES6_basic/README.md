# 0x00. ES6 Basics

## Project Description

This project covers the basics of ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) in JavaScript. It includes concepts such as ES6 syntax, arrow functions, default parameters, rest parameters, spread syntax, template literals, block-scoped variables, object property shorthand syntax, method properties, iterators, and for-of loops. Additionally, it involves setting up a development environment using NodeJS and specific tools like Jest for testing and ESLint for linting.

### Project Timeline
- **Start Date:** May 27, 2024 6:00 AM
- **End Date:** May 28, 2024 6:00 AM
- **Checker Release Date:** May 27, 2024 12:00 PM
- **Auto Review:** Launches at the deadline

## Concepts Covered
- JavaScript programming fundamentals
- ES6 syntax features
- Software linting using ESLint

### Resources
- [ECMAScript 6 - ECMAScript 2015](https://262.ecma-international.org/6.0/)
- Statements and declarations
- Arrow functions
- Default parameters
- Rest parameter
- [Javascript ES6 â€” Iterables and Iterators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:
- What ES6 is and its new features
- The difference between a constant and a variable
- Block-scoped variables
- Arrow functions and function parameters defaulting to them
- Rest and spread function parameters
- String templating in ES6
- Object creation and properties in ES6
- Iterators and for-of loops

## Requirements
### General
- All files executed on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using NodeJS 12.11.x
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code
- All files should end with a newline
- A mandatory `README.md` file at the project root
- Code files should use the `.js` extension
- Testing with Jest Testing Framework
- Code analysis using ESLint with specific rules provided
- All functions must be exported

## Setup
- Install NodeJS 12.11.x:
  ```bash
  curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
  sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
  sudo apt install nodejs -y
  nodejs -v
  npm -v
Install Jest, Babel, and ESLint:
Navigate to your project directory and run npm install
Configuration files
Add the following files to your project directory:

package.json
babel.config.js
.eslintrc.js
Final Step
Don't forget to run npm install from the terminal of your project folder to install all necessary project dependencies.

Tasks Overview
This project consists of multiple tasks, each focusing on a specific ES6 feature. Each task has its own code file and corresponding test files.

Task List
Const or let?
Block Scope
Arrow functions
Parameter defaults

The wonders of spread syntax
Take advantage of template literals
Object property value shorthand syntax
No need to create empty objects before adding in properties
ES6 method properties
For...of Loops
Iterator
Each task has its own execution example and repository details.
